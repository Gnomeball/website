\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	In line with the aims of \texttt{swan\_hack}, the purpose of this document is to ensure a welcoming and safe environment to anyone and everyone who might take an interest, at any level of skill. 
	
	\section{General Rules}
	The following is a list of general rules and guidelines we ask members to adhere to when at meets and interacting with each other online. Violation of these rules or other activity deemed as offences to the aims of \texttt{swan\_hack} are listed in the \emph{Tiers of Offences} section.
    \textbf{The final say as to what is and is not permitted at meets and online is reserved for the committee.}
    
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Behaviour that resembles bullying or harassment in any form will not be tolerated under any circumstances. 
		\item While it is often inevitable for a discussion to turn into a heated one, committee reserves the right to ask both parties to calm down or change topic.
		\item Be friendly and welcoming to new members. If someone doesn't have as much as experience as you in a certain area, encourage and share resources with them that you found useful.
		\item Don't make anything that could cause physical injury. Explosions and fast moving objects aside, lasers or rapid flashing lights can be harmful all the same. If you are planning on doing something spectacular please clear with those around you first, and be mindful of what you might take for granted.
		\item The opinion of one individual does not represent the opinion of the entire community.
		\item Please keep your projects within the laws of the United Kingdom (to a reasonable extent).
	\end{itemize}   
	
	\section{Tiers of Offences}
	During a violation of the above rules or other actions deemed as offences to the aims of \texttt{swan\_hack}, the moderator reserves the right to decide which tier the offence belongs to, depending on its severity, and execute the specified action on the offender. Moderators may or may not notify the offender of the reason as to why this action was taken.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tier 1 - A direct message from a moderator requesting something in relation to recent activity. This can occur for minor offences that a moderator deems to break a rule. 
	    \item Tier 2 - A server-wide mute of a specified length, sent in a DM. This can occur when a Tier 1 action is not followed, or due to spam of any kind, or if the severity, decided by a moderator, is high enough. 
	    \item Tier 3 - A ban from our discord server. This can occur when a Tier 1 request is not followed, a Tier 2 offence is repeated, or if the severity, decided by a moderator, is high enough. 
	    \item Tier 4 - (Paid members) A ban from the society. This can occurs when the severity of an offence, decided by a moderator, is high enough, and includes offences outside of the swan\_hack Discord server.
	\end{itemize}
