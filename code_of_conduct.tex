\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	In line with the aims of \texttt{swan\_hack}, the purpose of this document is to ensure a welcoming and safe environment to anyone and everyone who might take an interest, at any level of skill. 
	
	The following is a list of principles and general rules we ask members to adhere to when at meets and interacting with each other online. Continuous breaking of these principles will result in a ban.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Be friendly and welcoming to new members. If someone doesn't have as much as experience as you in a certain area, encourage and share resources with them that you found useful.
		\item Don't make anything that could cause physical injury. Explosions and fast moving objects aside, lasers or rapid flashing lights can be harmful all the same. If you are planning on doing something spectacular please clear with those around you first, and be mindful of what you might take for granted.
		\item Behaviour that resembles bullying or harassment in any form will not be tolerated.
		\item While sometimes it is inevitable for a discussion to end up as a heated one, please remember that both sides are people with their own opinions. Committee members have a right to ask you to either calm down or stop if you are part of a heated debate.
		\item Discussing highly controversial topics that could directly affect a person's life or health are not permitted. \texttt{swan\_hack} is mostly made of hobbyists, not professionals, therefore if you disagree with commonly accepted or government advice regarding a topic of this nature, please bring your concerns up at a community of experts rather than hobbyists. 
		\item The opinion of one individual does not represent the opinion of the entire community.
		\item Please keep your projects within the laws of the United Kingdom (to a reasonable extent).
	\end{itemize}

	The committee reserves the right to vote on other reasonable actions that may be required if the committee and community feel that an individual is causing significant trouble towards the environment.
