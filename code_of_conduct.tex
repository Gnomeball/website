	\maketitle
	In line with the aims of \texttt{swan\_hack}, the purpose of this document is to ensure a welcoming environment to anyone and everyone who might take an interest, at any level of skill. 
	
	The following is a list of principles we ask members to adhere to when at meets and interacting with each other online.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Be friendly and welcoming to new members. If someone doesn't have as much as experience as you in a certain area, encourage and share resources with them that you found useful.
		\item Don't make anything that could cause physical injury. Explosions and fast moving objects aside, lasers or rapid flashing lights can be harmful all the same. If you are planning on doing something spectacular please clear with those around you first, and be mindful of what you might take for granted.
		\item Behaviour that resembles bullying or harassment in any form will not be tolerated.
		\item Please keep your projects within the laws of the United Kingdom (to a reasonable extent).
	\end{itemize}

	The final say as to what is and is not permitted at meets and online is reserved for the committee.
